# FID Score Calculation

This guide explains how to calculate the FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) score using the `pytorch-fid` package. The FID score is a popular metric used to evaluate the quality of images generated by generative models by comparing them to a set of ground truth images.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure two sets of images: one for **ground truth** and another for **generated images**.

## Steps

1. **Clone the PyTorch FID Repository:**

    Begin by cloning the `pytorch-fid` repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid.git
    ```

2. **Install the `pytorch-fid` package:**

    Navigate into the cloned repository and install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pytorch-fid
    ```

3. **Navigate to the working directory:**

    Move into the directory where you plan to run the FID calculation:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/pytorch-fid
    ```

4. **Run the FID calculation:**

    Use the following command to compute the FID score between your **ground truth** and **generated images**. Replace the paths below with the directories where your own images are stored:

    ```bash
    python -m pytorch_fid /path/to/ground_truth_images /path/to/generated_images
    ```

    - `/path/to/ground_truth_images` should point to the directory containing your **ground truth** images.
    - `/path/to/generated_images` should point to the directory containing your **generated** images.

5. **View the FID score:**

    Once the script is executed, the FID score will be displayed in the terminal. A lower FID score indicates a closer match between the generated and ground truth images.

## Notes

- The InceptionV3 model used for the FID score calculation is downloaded automatically when you run the script for the first time.
- Ensure that the images in both the ground truth and generated image directories have the same dimensions for an accurate FID score.
